# Module 8 : Weather-App

## Description

This week's challenge was to create an app that allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing. As with all other this app too will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery as well as API calls from OpenWeather Api. 

## Functionality

When the user opens the app, enters a city, then today's weather is displayed as well as the weather data for five days. 

##  Usage
To see the weather for the day, please navigate to  https://kashfeeh.github.io/Weather-App/
